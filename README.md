# Purpose

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is an experiment ground for me to explore different react library as I was new to React. The folder structure is mimicking bulletproof-react as I find its modular approach very clean and with minimum dependency between the core and different modules (called features as folder name).

At the time of writing, it used eslint, emotion/react, mui(v5), @craco/craco.

## Available Scripts

`craco start`

`craco test`

`craco build`
